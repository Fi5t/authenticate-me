# Authenticate me. If you can...
This repository contains the source code for my article about PIN & Biometrics authentication methods in Android apps.

### Structure 
For your comfort the repository is divided by several branches according to the article structure:  
* simple_way
* lets_make_it_better
* tht_right_way
* what_about_biometrics

Each branch contains the final solution for the corresponding step.

### Architecture
This project is not about **the right architecture&#8482;**, but rather about authentication and security principles behind this process. Feel free to adapt these approaches to your needs.
