# Authenticate me. If you can...
This repository contains the source code for my article about PIN & Biometrics authentication methods in Android apps.

### Structure 
For your comfort the repository is divided by several branches according to the article structure:  
* [simple_way](https://github.com/Fi5t/authenticate-me/tree/simple_way)
* [lets_make_it_better](https://github.com/Fi5t/authenticate-me/tree/lets_make_it_better)
* [tht_right_way](https://github.com/Fi5t/authenticate-me/tree/the_right_way)
* [what_about_biometrics](https://github.com/Fi5t/authenticate-me/tree/what_about_biometrics)

Each branch contains the final solution for the corresponding step.

### Architecture
This project is not about **the right architecture&#8482;**, but rather about authentication and security principles behind this process. Feel free to adapt these approaches to your needs.
